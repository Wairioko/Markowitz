# Markowitz
A program that creates portfolios that maximize expected return given a specific risk level nd plots this data on graphs using matplotlib. The portfolio is built from chosen companies in the S&P 500 with historical data being extracted from yahoo finance.
Program is based on the Modern Portfolio Theory by Harry markowitz.
This theory was based on two main concepts:

1. Every investor’s goal is to maximize return for any level of risk
2. Risk can be reduced by diversifying a portfolio through individual, unrelated securities

MPT works under the assumption that investors are risk-averse, preferring a portfolio with less risk for a given level of return. Under this assumption, investors will only take on high-risk investments if they can expect a larger reward.
Under the MPT—or mean-variance analysis—an investor can hold a high-risk asset, mutual fund, or security, so long as this high-risk investment is minimized by all underlying assets. The portfolio itself is balanced in a way that its overall risk is lower than some of its underlying investments.
